Provided train_data has 31845 rows, 165 time series. Median time series length is 193 (min=193, max=193). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'Close'
	past_covariates:
		categorical:        ['__item_id']
		continuous (float): []

To learn how to fix incorrectly inferred types, please see documentation for TimeSeriesPredictor.fit

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'SQL'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
